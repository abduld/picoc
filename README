picoc
-----

PicoC is a very small C interpreter. It's intended for use as a script 
language for embedded systems. It was originally written to be the
script language for a UAV on-board flight system and is very suitable 
for other robotic, embedded and also non-embedded applications.

The core C source code is less than 3000 lines of code. When compiled 
it only takes a few k of code space and is also very sparing of data 
space. This means it can work well in small embedded devices. It's also 
a fun example of how to create a very small language implementation 
while still keeping the code readable.



Compiling picoc
---------------

picoc can be compiled for a UNIX/Linux/POSIX host by typing "make".

The test suite can be run by typing "make test".


Porting picoc
-------------

platform.h is where you select your platform type and specify the includes 
etc. for your platform.

platform_support.c contains support functions so the compiler can work on 
your platform, such as how to write characters to the console etc..

platform_library.c contains your library of functions you want to make 
available to user programs.

There's also a new clibrary.c which contains user library functions like 
printf() which are platform-independent.

Porting the system will involve setting up suitable includes and defines 
in platform.h, writing some I/O routines in platform_support.c, putting 
whatever user functions you want in platform_library.c and then changing 
the main program in picoc.c to whatever you need to do to get programs 
into the system.

platform.h is set to UNIX_HOST by default so tests can be easily run on
a UNIX system. You'll need to specify your own host setup dependent on 
your target platform.
