TODO

Implement:
* operator precedence
* '->'
* pointer arithmetic
* casts
* enum
* fix #include

Improvements:
* #define with arguments
* pointers to array elements and struct elements
* test character array pointers and dereferencing
* make printf() honour memory constraints
* fix type comparison to take into account array size
* fix return of array types
* expression and auto-cast support for all types
* change heap to use a single consistent freelist node struct
* periodic heap cleanup
* octal/hex character constants

Need test/debug:
* all break/continue variations

Also:
* Remove Var parameter from HeapPopStack() once we're certain it all works
